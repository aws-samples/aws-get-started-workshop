A history of notable changes to the guide.

|Date|Change|Description|Upgrading|
|----|------|-----------|---------|
|September 21, 2020|**Simplified site structure**|Decoupled setting up your base foundation from setting up your foundation for team development environments. Made team development environments an optional capability that you can defer if you'd like to go straight to setting up your foundation for test and production environments.|Not applicable. New capability.|
|September 15, 2020|**Integrated AWS Site-to-Site VPN with AWS Transit Gateway**|New section added to address this optional capability.|Not applicable. New capability.|
|June 24, 2020|**Changed example system identifier from `base` to `infra`**|Example resource names were changed to refer to `infra` vs the previous `base`.  This change was done to more closely align with use of the term infrastructure for foundational resources.|No changes necessary unless you've already used `base` and would like to switch to using `infra` or similar.|
|June 23, 2020|**Provide Cloud Foundation team with development environment and sufficient access**|Addressed provisioning a distinct team development AWS account for the Cloud Foundation team and a separate OU with less restrictive access controls so that the team can have more write access to VPC resources than other teams.|No changes necessary. You can review the updated documentation if you'd like to learn from the new configuration.|
|June 23, 2020|**Streamline new AWS account user management**|No longer create a new AWS SSO user when using AWS Control Tower's Account Factory when creating a new AWS account.  Instruct the customer to remove the individual permissions granted by Account Factory.|No changes necessary. You can review the updated documentation and remove any lingering and unnecessary AWS account level AWS SSO users.|
|June 21 2020|**Realign example AWS account names, OUs, and AWS SSO group names**|Diagrams have been added to show example OUs and AWS account names. Names of these resources have been better aligned with naming best practices.|No changes necessary. If you'd like to rename your existing AWS accounts and OUs, you can do so using standard processes, but you will need to update your landing zone via AWS Control Tower to bring it in sync with your name changes. See [Managing Resources Outside of AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/external-resources.html) for details.|
|May 1 2020|**Fix SCPs to work with AWS Control Tower new account baselining**|The sample network oriented SCPs were modified to allow for AWS Control Tower to carry out its network baselining tasks when a new AWS account is created via the Account Factory.<br><br>The failure symptom is when you create a new AWS account via Account Factory and receive the error "Enrollment failed..." and the provisioned product in AWS Service Catalog states "not authorized to baseline the VPC".|As a Cloud Administrator in the master AWS account, use AWS Organizations to update the existing sample network oriented SCPs with the updated samples in this guide.<br><br>If you have a new AWS account in a failed state as described above, you can terminate the provisioned product in AWS Service Catalog and then use AWS Control Tower and Account Factory to go through the creation process again.  Ensure that you enter the same email address and other information when you attempt the AWS account creation process the second time.  The Account Factory will pick up where it left off and complete its provisioning process.|
|April 23 2020|**Introduce initial set of Service Control Policies (SCPs) and apply to team development environments**|The sample IAM SAML policy and permissions boundary policy for team development environments were streamlined through the removal of the VPC related deny permissions and the introduction of several AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) to deny these actions summarily across AWS accounts in the `development` organizational unit (OU).|1. Follow the new instructions to create the SCPs and apply them to the `development` OU.<br><br>2. Redeploy the AWS SSO permission set for team development environment access using the updated sample policy.<br><br>3. Redploy the CloudFormation StackSet for the team development IAM permissions boundary using the updated sample policy.|
|April 22 2020|**AWS Control Tower supports reusing existing master AWS accounts**|Address scenarios where you might want to reuse an existing master AWS account with AWS Control Tower.|Applies only to new AWS environment build outs.|
|March 31 2020|**No longer share public subnets**|Share only private subnets with team development accounts so that builder teams can't enable Internet access to their development workloads.|Review the updated instructions. In Resource Access Manager in the Network account, remove sharing of the public subnets.|
|March 27 2020|**Enhance team development IAM policies with NotAction**|Using the AWS managed IAM policy developer oriented `PowerUserAccess` as a basis, make the SAML policy and permissions boundary more secure by default by patterning a portion of them after the PowerUser managed policy.|1. Redeploy the AWS SSO permission set for team development environment access using the updated sample policy.<br><br>2. Redploy the CloudFormation StackSet for the team development IAM permissions boundary using the updated sample policy.|
|March 15 2020|**Convert to Hugo static site generator**|Make it easier to browse the guide via a web site as compared to browsing markdown files in the git repository.|No changes necessary.|
|March 1 2020|**Initial form of team development access controls based on IAM permissions boundaries**|A means to enable builder teams with wide ranging access in their team development environments, but not able to modify the underlying foundation resources.|See the instructions for setting up access control for team development environments.|
