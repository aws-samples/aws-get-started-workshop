**Review Note:** The production fast follow capabilities are only sketched out topically at this stage. We expect to begin addressing them after the [Introduction]({{< relref "00-intro" >}}) and [Establish Development Environments]({{< relref "01-dev" >}}) sections are completed from a draft perspective. If you have comments and suggestions about this guide, see [Contributing]({{< relref "03-contributors" >}}).

Depending on your organizations needs, additional capabilities may be required either as part of your initial build out of pre-production test and production environments or shortly thereafter. The following sections address the most common production "fast follow" capabilities and provide references to current best practices to establish these capabilities.
