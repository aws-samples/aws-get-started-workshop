# Workshop to Get Started with AWS for Formal Workloads

This repository contains documentation and sample code for a guided workshop to help customers accelerate the process of getting an initial foundation established in AWS in support of their first set of development, pre-production test, and production environments.  This initial foundation is an important step in helping customers quickly get their first few workloads into production so that they can start deriving value from this early stage of using the AWS cloud platform before making further foundational investments and expanding their adoption of AWS.
